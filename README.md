# Web-Analytics-Project
This project aims to unfold some of the key elements that make content creators on YouTube successful. This is done by focusing on the single case of one successful YouTuber and how he chooses his content, video-posting frequency, and other key drivers.

This project includes: 
* Scraping of HTML data from a YouTube channel.
* Data cleaning and exploration.
* Topic Modelling, Network Analysis, and Sentiment Analysis.
* Data visualization of the findings.
* A scientific report explaining all the project steps along with the limitations.
